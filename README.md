Registry
========

Registry is a web application to help school teachers with certain administrative tasks of a school class. Although it
is a fairly small application it implements all best practices as far as security, stability and scalability is concerned.
Features are constantly added and feature requests are kindly encouraged.

Currently the application uses Greek localization, with English planned next.
